1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
All right, so I just want to give you guys an overview of what will be building in this course, so

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,010
we're going to build this from absolute scratch.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,860
We're going to deploy it to Heroku.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm going to leave the Redux Dev tools open so you can see the actions that are fired off and you

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,300
can see the state def and all that stuff.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,180
And if you don't understand this, don't worry about it.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
We're going to get to Redox later.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,690
So on the home page here we have our Navar.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,010
We can search products.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,350
We have a link to our shopping cart.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,960
We have a sign in register page.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,240
And right here we have a carousel where we're showing the top rated products and we can click on one

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,570
of these.

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,190
It takes us to the product page.

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,700
And then down here we have the latest products and we have six total in the database.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,240
Now, if we have more than 10, then we're going to show our pagination links down here.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,850
You can see in our state how we get the products.

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,140
We also get the number of pages, which is one and the page, which is one.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,700
So if pages is more than one, it'll show the links down here to go to the next page.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,020
So let's click on one of these and take a look at the product page.

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,820
We have an image title description.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,250
We have the the overall rating.

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,920
So the the average rating, the quantity which pertains to the count in stock.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,220
So if we look at this in the state here, account in stock for this product is three.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,200
So we get an option of three.

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,990
And then down here we have our views.

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,550
And if you're logged in, you can see a form here to write a review.

28
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,850
And of course, you can only write one review per product.

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,780
So I'm just going to pretend like I just came to the site and I'm going to buy this.

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,080
So I'll add this to my cart immediately.

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,230
It shows it in my shopping cart if I add something else.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,010
So this this Aleksa here is actually out of stock.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,430
So this is disabled.

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,270
We can't add it.

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,640
So I'll grab this mouse right here.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,190
Add to cart.

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,120
Now, if I change the quantity within the car, you'll see that this will actually update over here

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,010
the number of items and the price.

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,160
And of course, our cart items are stored in local storage.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,390
So we can leave the page.

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,660
We can even close the browser and come back and the products will still be here.

42
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,980
So let's proceed to checkout and this is as far as we can go without logging in.

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,580
So I'm going to log in as John, which is just a regular customer account, and it'll take me right

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,250
to the shipping page and you can see the steps up here.

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,670
So sign in shipping payment and then place order.

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,460
So I'm going to just put whatever in here.

47
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,510
And this those shipping address will also get saved to local storage so that if you come back, it'll

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,960
be here.

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,660
So continue now for the payment method, we're going to implement the PayPal API, you can also use

50
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,860
a debit or credit card.

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,740
And the way we're going to build it, it's going to be scalable.

52
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,090
So you can add other payment methods if you want, like if you want to add stripe or something like

53
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,440
that.

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,480
In fact, if I click continue, you'll see over here calls card save pay method and we have a payment

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,410
method, PayPal.

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,470
So you could easily, you know, swap that out for Stripe.

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,530
You just have to implement Stripe's API.

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,780
So here we have basically a summary of everything.

59
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,390
So all of our items, the payment method, the shipping address, the price, including shipping and

60
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,170
taxes.

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,880
So we'll click place order.

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,990
And what that did is it put in order in the database, but it's set to not paid.

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,570
So there's going to be a flag is paid and that's set to false until we actually pay.

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
Same thing with delivered.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,510
We can set an admin, can set this to delivered as well.

66
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,010
So to pay we can use PayPal.

67
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,100
You can also use a debit or credit card and we're going to set up a fake sandbox account that we can

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,430
use.

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,470
So you can see sandbox dot PayPal.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,040
So we're not dealing with actual money right now and it's going to lock me in automatically as my fake

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,670
John Doe account and these fake bank accounts.

72
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,190
So I'll click pay now and then.

73
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,990
Once that process is, this will reload and now you'll see paid on with the date.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,630
And if we look at our order over here is paid is now set to true payment result we're storing in the

75
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,180
database.

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,640
This is actually information from PayPal, including like the PayPal email that the ID stuff like that.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,700
So now this has been paid.

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,940
So if I go up here and I view my profile, I can see that order in my profile.

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,980
I can see where when it's been paid, I can see it's not been delivered or set out for delivered.

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,720
And I can view the details as well.

81
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,410
And then over here I can update my user data if I want.

82
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,200
OK, so we can also leave reviews and we can only leave one review.

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
You can see already left one here.

84
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,740
So if I try to put something in here, it's going to tell me that I already reviewed this product.

85
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,740
OK, now I'm going to log out here and log back in as an admin.

86
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,550
And when you're an admin, you get this additional dropdown item and we can see all of our users here,

87
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,280
so we have admin, we have John and Jane Doe, which are customers.

88
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,260
And I could edit their information.

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,510
I could set them to admin if I wanted to, and then they would be able to, you know, have this functionality.

90
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,880
We can see all the products.

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,950
And I'll show you how to add a product in a second.

92
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,280
But if we go here, we can see orders.

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,480
This is the order that John Doe just placed.

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,710
If I go to details, as long as I'm an admin, I'll see this mark as delivered.

95
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,560
And if I click that, it's going to update the database and you can see is delivered is now set to true

96
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,050
and then delivered at is set to whatever the date and time is.

97
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,040
So now the user can come in to this order page and see that it's been delivered or set for delivered

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,570
and let's see.

99
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,010
So products let's go ahead and create a project product.

100
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,790
So as soon as I click this, it's going to create it and bring me to the edit page with some sample

101
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,920
data so I can then add in here.

102
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:49,770
I'll just say test product and for the price will say 10 and let's do 10 and stock them for the image.

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,690
You can either manually put a link in here to an image or you are all to an image or you can choose

104
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,340
to upload.

105
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,830
So I'll just grab this Chrome logo so that gets uploaded and then we click update and there's our test

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,280
product.

107
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,580
And if there's more than 10, it'll also have pagination here as well.

108
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,270
As you can see in the state, it uses that same product list state.

109
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,700
So if we go back to the front page here and go down, you'll see the test product.

110
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,890
And we have that product page here that we can add to the cart we can now purchase.

111
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,150
So we can obviously delete them or edit them.

112
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,100
We can delete them.

113
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,470
OK, so that clears that out and now it's gone and we can also search our filters.

114
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,180
So if I just put like IP, that's going to narrow it down to to the iPhone.

115
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,300
If I clear this out and click search, it just takes us to the home page.

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,350
So there's actually quite a bit of functionality here.

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,750
I mean, it's no eBay, but we're building this from the ground up.

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,630
We're not using, you know, woo commerce or something like that.

119
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,710
It's just create react app and then all custom code from there.

120
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,170
No copying and pasting or anything like that.

121
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,710
We do have some just sample products, some sample data that will load.

122
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:05,010
We're going to build the database ceder so that we can seed the database with products and users, but

123
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,610
that's about it.

124
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,570
Everything else is hand coded and you're going to learn a lot in this course.

125
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,370
Even if you already know react and you know the mission stack, I think you'll still have fun building

126
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,880
this out.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,760
So let's go ahead and get started.
