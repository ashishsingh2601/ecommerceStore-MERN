Hey, what's going on, guys?

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,430
Welcome to my Mern stack e commerce course, so I just want to take a couple of minutes and kind of

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,970
let you know what this course is about, what's required and so on.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,730
So this is a single project cause it's one large project, probably the largest that I've done in the

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,270
course.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,220
And it's going to be an e-commerce platform with a full fledged, you know, shopping cart checkout

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,070
system will integrate the PayPal API so we can pay with PayPal or credit or debit card.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
We'll have a product review and rating system.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,130
Customers will be able to, you know, view all their orders, will have an admin area where you can

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,910
manage your users, your products, your orders and so on.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,670
Now, as far as what you need to know to take this course, I would say at least the basics of react.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,220
You definitely don't have to be a pro as long as you know what a component is, what state is, what

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,380
props are, just the very basics.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,560
If you've watched a crash course or two, that should be enough.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,050
And as far as the back end, using note and express, you don't really have to have much experience.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,380
But if you can build a simple rest API, that's fine.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,280
You don't know.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,720
You don't have to know, Jason.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,410
Web tokens or anything like that because we're going to go through all that in this course.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,080
All right.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,680
So again, this is project based.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,910
It's not a video documentation type course.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,140
So if you like to jump in and get your hands dirty and actually build something that you can in the

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,690
end customize, you can put on your portfolio, then I think you're going to like this course.

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,130
So in the next video, I want to jump in and show you a demo of the exact project that will be building.
