1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,740
So in this video, I just want to go over my environment, my text editor, some of the extensions I'll

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,930
be using and also some of the resources for this course and stuff will be using in the course.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,050
So this is the repository for the final project.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,980
It's under my GitHub account, Brad Trabelsi and its pro shopman.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,870
So you can come here, you can see all the the files for this project.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,670
And also, if you go to the comments, what I tried to do is do a get comment.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,870
After every video, there were a couple times where I forgot.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,890
So there was like a few videos worth of code in in some of these comments.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,590
But for the most part, they match up with each video.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,370
So, for instance, when we created the order pay producer and action.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,030
So if you wanted to see the exact code that was added, you can come here and you could see what was

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,700
added or what was removed.

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,840
So that should be helpful to you if if something's, you know, if you're messed up with something and

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,190
you need to see the final code.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,030
So I'm using Visual Studio code for my text editor.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,610
Chances are a lot of you are using this.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,780
It's very popular in the Web dev community and I would highly recommend it.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,590
But if you want to use, like, sublime text or Adam or some kind of idy, so anything that you use

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,360
that you used to, that's absolutely fine.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,860
You don't have to use voice code.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,800
It's just what I use and what I usually suggest.

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,610
And it's of course it's cross platform.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,750
Next you need to have not just installed on your machine if you don't just go to NOGs Dog.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,660
And I would suggest grabbing the latest version.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,970
We're actually going to be using its modules on our back end, which is the import syntax.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,440
So it's the same syntax as the front end with react and after version.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,940
I believe it was 14. Six of No Jass.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
You don't have to add the experimental modules flag.

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,610
So I would definitely suggest using at least 14 dot six.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,610
But if you grab the current version, that would be the best option.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,540
So the next thing that you should have installed is the Get Virgin control system.

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,180
I would suggest making comments throughout the course.

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,420
It doesn't have to be after every video, but whenever you feel, you know, you see fit, we will be

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,920
needing to use git at the end to deploy to Hiroku so you can download it.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,770
They get Dasch AskMen.com or you can install it with homebrewed on a Mac and there's other ways to install

36
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,760
on Linux and stuff.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,710
So Postman is an API tool or an HTTP client that we're going to use to test out backend endpoints or

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,520
back end routes before we actually integrate them into our front end and to react and into our reduc

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,300
state flow.

40
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,330
So you can download this at Posman dot com.

41
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,830
And then I also want to just give a shout out to my partner on this course, Bushier.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,680
So he had a huge hand in the project for this course and he's actually going to be covering the Q&amp;A

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,090
section on Udemy.

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,710
So if you have a question, if you run into some issues and you leave a message in the Q&amp;A, either

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,810
Boissiere or myself, we'll get back to you.

46
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:05,160
And he's more than capable of handling the Q&amp;A actually specializes in e-commerce with React and Redux

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,030
and Express.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,030
And he also has a YouTube channel like Coding with Boissiere.

49
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,070
So if you want to give him a subscribe.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,240
All right.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,550
So let's jump into Vrsaljko code.

52
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,320
And I just want to kind of go over the extensions in the settings that I'm using, just in case you

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,560
want to follow along to a tee and you don't want to run into any issues where, you know, our environments

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,450
don't match up or something's happening with with with my screen that's not happening with yours.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,900
So as far as extensions, nothing nothing spectacular.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,090
I'm using this S7 react redux, graphical react, native snippets.

57
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,870
And basically I just use this to quickly generate react components.

58
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,270
So we have shortcuts for lots of different things, imports, exports.

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,160
I don't use it too much for that though.

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,610
I basically just use it for the for these here.

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,410
So to generate react components, if like if you want a class component, you can do RCC.

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,710
What we'll be using for the most part is the react arrow function right here.

63
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,750
R.A.F. see.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,310
So react arrow function component export.

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,130
I like to use this syntax for my components.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,810
All right, so if that bracket pair there is something I recommend but definitely isn't needed, it

67
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,730
just kind of organizes things visually because it colorize is your curly braces, your brackets, your

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,400
parentheses and just makes everything nice and neat.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,520
And you can see, you know what where the curly braces and you can see these are purple, the nested

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,570
ones in here are blue.

71
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,410
So I've used that for years, this auto rename tag.

72
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,950
So this works with HTML and J.S. React.

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,230
Basically if you change the beginning tag it's going to change the ending tag as well automatically.

74
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,780
So you'll see that happen on my screen.

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,830
And that's why and I would suggest adding this to this code.

76
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,420
Let's see what else.

77
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,190
I'm also using the JavaScript S6 code snippets I don't use.

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,690
This too much, it's basically for just console logs, you can just do CLG enter and it will print out

79
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,620
console log.

80
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,560
So it's not something you need, but it's something that I do use.

81
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,260
And then lastly, I have prettier install, which is a code formatter.

82
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,550
Now as far as like excellent and setting up lending, I'm not going to do that.

83
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,280
I just want to keep everything kind of bare bones.

84
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,810
But I do use pretty er to to actually remove semicolons.

85
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,360
I don't use semicolon so I set it to delete them if I accidentally put one in.

86
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,490
You can do the other way around as well.

87
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,470
Also for, for single quotes.

88
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,160
And I'll show you my prettier setup in a second, but I do use that.

89
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,580
So now I'm just going to go to my settings here.

90
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,840
And one thing I do use is the Savon format.

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,390
So if we search for save or I said that backwards format on save.

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,700
You see, I have this checked, and basically what that means is if I edit something, so let's just

93
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
open up some file here.

94
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,800
So if I have this, like over here and it's not formatted nicely when I save, it automatically puts

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,340
it back.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Also, I'm not using semicolon.

97
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,840
So if I have a semicolon and I save it just gets rid of it if I have double quotes.

98
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:24,130
So if I choose, you know, to use double quotes here and save it automatically changes it single.

99
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,360
And where I have that configured is in settings and then if we search for prettier.

100
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,060
So my setup is not not too crazy.

101
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:47,230
I just have a single quote checked and I have semicolons unchecked and I have single quote checked and

102
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,950
then my tab with I'm using to and if if we take a look at my settings file, if we do command shift

103
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:00,850
P and settings and open the adjacent file here, this is just all my settings, my font size, which

104
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,110
is obviously beefed up so you guys can see it, the terminal font size, prettier single quote set to

105
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,530
true.

106
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,820
So nothing crazy.

107
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,810
I know some people have these insane VSC code configurations, but I don't do that because I, I do

108
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,190
a lot of videos and courses.

109
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,980
So I like to try to keep things as bare bones as possible.

110
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,400
But still using the rules that I like, like no semicolons and, you know, single quote, stuff like

111
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,700
that.

112
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,770
So that's pretty much it for my setup.

113
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,010
So it's up to you on what you want to use.

114
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,810
I know a lot of people use semicolons.

115
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,800
I just stopped using them maybe three or four months ago, but.

116
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,590
But that's it.

117
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,180
So in the next video, we'll jump right in and get started on our project.
